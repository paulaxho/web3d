History of Qeleshe: 1886-1892
The qeleshe, also known as plis and qylat, is a white brimless felt skull cap traditionally worn by Albanians. The Albanian qeleshe has been handed down from Illyrian time and it has spread throughout Albanian-inhabited territories. 
It is today part of the traditional costume of the Albanians. The height and shape of the cap varies region to region.
The cap is part of the traditional costume of the Albanian highlanders and is considered as a national symbol among a large number of Albanian communities.

Cifteli
The çiftelia is a traditional Albanian string instrument that originates from the Albanian regions of the Balkans. It is particularly associated with the folk music of Albania, especially in the northern areas such as Kosovo and the Albanian Alps. 
The instrument typically features two strings and is played with a plectrum. It is known for its distinctive sound and is often used in traditional Albanian music to accompany singing and dancing. 
The çifteli is frequently used by Albanians in weddings and at concerts, as well as by many musicians, such as Nikollë Nikprelaj. It is also used to accompany Albanian epics and ballads.

The çiftelia reflects the rich cultural heritage of Albania and is an important symbol of its musical traditions.


Skenderbeg Sword
Skanderbeg was a prominent figure in the history of Albania. His weapons have been subjects of mythical adoration. 
According to legends, his sword was so heavy that only his arm could wield it. It was also said to be so sharp that it could slice a man vertically from head to waist with little effort and cut a huge boulder in half with a single blow. Of all of Skanderbeg's belongings, only four objects remain: two swords, a helmet, and a prayer book.
The straight sword, which lies at the Museum of Ambras along with the helmet, is double-edged. The blade is dressed in gold. It is 85.5 centimeters long, 5.7 cm wide, and weighs 1.3 kilograms. Its scabbard is made of leather. According to Faik Konica, who viewed the sword at the beginning of the 20th century, there were still stains of blood on the blade.
